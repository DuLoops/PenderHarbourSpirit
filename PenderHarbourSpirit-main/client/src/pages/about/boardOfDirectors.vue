          has been a Director since 2019. Dave and his brother Richard own and operate the popular Oak Tree Market, a general store specializing in fresh local meats and vegetables. The Massullo brothers also own and operate the Harbour Pizza right next door to the Oak Tree Market. Here is a funny tidbit. The Oak Tree Market will be completing 22 years here but taking a closer look, it can be argued that they have been here for 4 decades. The 90s, 00s, 10s and now the 20s. We welcome Dave as our newest member of the board!
